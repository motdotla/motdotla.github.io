  I built <a href="http://fjunkmail.com">F Junk Mail</a> one friday night. I received my mail late that afternoon and it was nothing but Charter junkmail. Fed up, I put together F Junk Mail to spam Charter back.

<p>
  I used <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a> for payment processing and <a href="http://dev.sincerely.com/">Sincerely's API</a> for sending the postcards. It made for a fun friday night. The site <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4402220">trended</a> on Hacker News' frontpage for a significant part of Saturday and it continues to be used by others around the United States to retaliate against junkmail.
