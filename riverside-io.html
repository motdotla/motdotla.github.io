<p><a href="http://riverside.io">Riverside.io</a> was a dream that became a 
reality. There was a growing startup scene in Riverside and no home base for it. 
A group of us were heavily involved in that scene, and so we got together with a 
goal to start a coworking space.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mike_kennedy">Mike Kennedy</a>, 
<a href="https://twitter.com/jcblw">Jacob Lowe</a> and I took the lead for how 
we'd go from idea to reality. We began with a weekly 1 hour lunch meeting.</p>

<p>In each of those meetings, we made progress toward our goal - setting up a 
website, starting an email list, and scouting locations. The vision and progress 
attracted others and soon we were collecting $100 per month from over 10 
individuals. That attracted the <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs182/1109729377019/archive/1114460917089.html">City of Riverside</a> 
to get involved, and within 8 months we had opened Riverside's very first 
coworking space!</p>

<p>Since then <a href="http://riverside.io">Riverside.io</a> has become the 
central location for Riverside's growing startup scene. It has outgrown both its
first and second locations and continues to grow.</p>

</p>Small businesses and freelancers call it home, weekly meetups are held there, 
and most importantly great relationships have been built out of it. There's been 
a number of people involved in making this happen. It's been a great example of
the kind of success and good things that can come out of teamwork and 
collaboration.</p>
