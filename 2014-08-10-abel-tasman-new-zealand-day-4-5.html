<h2>Abel Tasman - New Zealand Day 4/5</h2>

<p>My car is off the <a href="http://www.bluebridge.co.nz/">ferry</a>. I’m on the South Island. I stop at the first gas station and fill up. Gas stations here are not pre-paid. They are on your honor. Fill up, note the cost, walk inside, and pay the cashier the amount due. I note to myself how I’ve never seen this in the USA, but I imagine it was the standard 40 years ago. Back on the road, I drive towards Nelson.</p>

<p>A few months back, I was tasked with creating the <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-apex">sendgrid-apex library</a> for our work. <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Apex_Code:_The_World's_First_On-Demand_Programming_Language">Apex</a> is a language like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> - only <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1670146">worse</a>. I sought out help to build it using <a href="http://www.airpair.com/">AirPair</a>. <a href="http://www.airpair.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-salesforce-apex-library">AirPair put me in touch with Daniel over Skype, and we pair programmed to write the sendgrid-apex library</a>. He lives in Nelson, New Zealand so I messaged him on twitter saying I’d be in town. Daniel and I set up a coffee meet for the next day.</p>

<p>Before too long, I was passing through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson,_New_Zealand">Nelson</a> on my way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Tasman_National_Park">Abel Tasman National Park</a>. I arrived late at night, pulled into a campground, paid $20 to park, had a warm shower, cooked some beans and a bit of meat, had two glasses of wine, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, I was up early for a hike along Abel Tasman’s famous trail. I hiked for just 3 hours. It was picturesque. I want to return someday and hike the entire trail.</p>

<p>Back in my car, I drove towards Nelson to meet with Daniel. I was an hour early for our coffee meetup, so I stopped into a surf shop. I walked out with a surfboard.</p>

<p>Daniel and I met at one Nelson’s fine coffee shops. I had an espresso. Daniel had a hot chocolate. We chatted about technology and New Zealand.</p>

<p>It was nice to meet in person someone who lives so far away from me yet <a href="https://twitter.com/motdotla/status/491347349776515073">was such a help to me on a professional task</a>. Technology and travel are delightful.</p>

<p>The barista took a photo of us, and then I was off; back to the ferry to catch the last one back to the North Island - my heart now set on surfing New Zealand’s west coast.</p>
