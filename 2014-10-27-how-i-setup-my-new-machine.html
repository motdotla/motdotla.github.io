<h2>How I setup my new machine</h2>

<p>FedEx arrived at my door this morning. It was my new machine - a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">13" MacBook Air</a>!</p>

<p>I set it up like the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/">iA Writer</a>. I do much of my writing on it - even this blog post.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>. It's still my favorite web browser.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/">OS X Yosemite</a>. I'm liking the flat look.</li>
  <li>Logged into Google Chrome. After doing so, all my bookmarks and extensions were automatically setup.</li>
  <li>Logged into <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> - my current password manager of choice. (Though, <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/lets-deprecate-password-email-authentication/">I'd like to see the password deprecated</a> over time.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://flexibits.com/FANTASTICAL">Fantastical Calendar</a>.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://qsapp.com/">Quicksilver</a>. Quicksilver is like Spotlight but better. The <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2369722/hands-on-with-os-x-yosemite-spotlight-takes-center-stage.html">new Spotlight search</a> is improved, but it's still slower than Quicksilver. Quicksilver also has a great <a href="http://cdn.appstorm.net/mac.appstorm.net/mac/files/2013/10/PW-QS3-05-largeType-1.png">'Large Type' feature</a> which I use for demos and presentations.</li>
  <li>Changed my desktop background to a photo from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://snapconverter.com/">Snap Converter</a>. This is the easiest way to resize images on your mac.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. This is my favorite package manager for installing softare from the command line on OS X.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/motdotla/1076952521bef53ae472/raw/be040c487f7b03ea5ea2bf44c20c2394b5652624/gistfile1.txt">Vim using homebrew</a>. Vim has become my text editor of choice. The learning curve was steep (2 weeks), but the speed benefits have been worth it. It is also great for code demos because of minimal chrome distraction.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://zanshin.net/2013/09/03/how-to-use-homebrew-zsh-instead-of-max-os-x-default/">zsh using homebrew</a>. I prefer zsh to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jaguardesignstudio/why-zsh-is-cooler-than-your-shell-16194692">bash</a>.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#the-manual-way">oh-my-zsh using the manual way</a>. This adds some nice defaults to my zsh config.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">Generated and added an SSH key to GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>Cloned <a href="http://github.com/motdotla/dotfiles">my dotfiles vimrc</a>.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a>. I like music, and I also really like their 'focus' station. I write better code with that station playing in the background.</li>
  <li>Logged into <a href="http://zhukov.github.io/webogram">Telegram on my machine</a>. Telegram is my favorite messsenging app - more than SMS, WhatsApp, HipChat, and even Slack. It's opensource, fast, and is a pleasure to use. It's just not as popular as the others.</li>
  <li>Lastly, I installed <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">Flux</a>. The blue of your screen after sunset might be contributing to your difficulty in sleeping. Flux fixes that. Stay healthy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on, I added some additional installs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. This is my software of choice for storing documents.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>. This is super handy for text shortcuts.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a>. Node/JavaScript is one of my favorite languages.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok</a>. I use this often for development - especially around webhooks.</li>
  <li>Installed <a href="http://panic.com/transmit">Transmit</a>. This is my FTP client of choice. There are free alternatives, but I've found this worth the cost.</li>
</ul>
