  <a href="http://gumbio.herokuapp.com">Gumb.io</a> is a gumroad marketplace.
</p>

<p>
  I built <a href="http://gumbio.herokuapp.com">Gumb.io</a> over a single weekend. <a href="http://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> had recently launched and I was impressed by it. I felt what it was missing though was a marketplace. I deduced the algorithm that generated the unique Gumroad links, and wrote a script to scrape most of the content on Gumroad.com into Gumb.io. As a result, Gumb.io became the world's first searchable Gumroad marketplace.

  After another weekend of hacking on it, I decided not to continue improving the project. It is still live, but I will probably discontinue it very soon.
