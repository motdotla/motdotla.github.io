  <a href="http://codecampus.com">CodeCampus</a> is a computer science training website for elementary teachers. It provides training and complete lesson plans for teachers to implement coding lessons into their elementary curriculum. 
<p>

<p>
  I was contracted to build the subscription platform for the lesson plans and training videos. I worked closely with the founder to implement <strong>authentication, advanced authorization via tiered membership layers, and payment processing</strong>. I also included an administrative backend so CodeCampus' support team could better serve it's users.

<p>Technologies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>Stripe Payment Processing</li>
  <li>RESTful APIs</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
