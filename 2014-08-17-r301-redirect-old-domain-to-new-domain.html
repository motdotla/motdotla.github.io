<h2>r301: Redirect Old Domain to New Domain</h2>

<img src="images/r301.gif"/>

<p>
  I needed a way to redirect my old domain to a new domain. I didn't find a solution I really liked so I built my own - <a href="http://github.com/scottmotte/r301">r301</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  I looked at some options like the following.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="https://github.com/nquinlan/jekyll-pageless-redirects">jekyll page redirects</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/htaccess/301-redirects/">using an htaccess file</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5855241/redirect-to-same-path-on-new-domain">using a php script</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The options were good in some scenarios, but not as easy as I would like to quickly switch my entire domain over. <a href="">r301</a> makes it easy.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/scottmotte/r301">r301</a> let's you quickly 301 permanently redirect from your old domain to your new domain.</p>

<p>It is a small application that you configure and deploy to heroku in just 5 minutes. I hope you find it useful. Instructions for configuration and deployment are in the <a href="https://github.com/scottmotte/r301">README</a>.</p>
