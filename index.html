<p>
I am the son of a farmer and a secretary. I grew up in a small town, on Southern California farmland. It was quintessential 'Small Town America' meets rapid demographic change.
</p>

<p>
My childhood was disciplined - academics, biblical studies, and piano lessons. And it was American - baseball, swimming pools, and classic cars.
</p>

<p>
After high school, I moved to Los Angeles to study International Business. I discovered computer programming freshman year, but I stuck with my business degree. I spent nights building websites. After graduation, I merged my two skills and sold websites to businesses.
</p>

<p>
In my 20s, I worked for multiple startups. I did product, engineering, sales, customer support, and even <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/author/scott/">developer evangelism</a>. From this I gained knowledge on how to build a software business.
</p>

<p>
Today, I work in <a href="https://www.alg.com/">corporate fintech</a>. I architect complex financial data processing systems for a team of data scientists and analysts. In my evenings, I am building my own fintech business.

<p>Personal purpose</p>

<p>Better habits, better man. I try to write software that inspires men to better habits, so they can be successful and attractive to women.</p>

<p>This has been a pursuit for me. My life improved as I improved my habits. Also, I see my generation of men struggling with this.</p>

<p>This is an antithesis to today's software which has men chasing petty addictions.</p>
