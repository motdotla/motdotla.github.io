<p>
I am the son of a farmer and a secretary. I grew up in <a href="http://www.southernhotel.org/">Perris</a>, on Southern California farmland. It was quintessential 'Small Town America' meets rapid demographic change.
</p>

<p>
My childhood was disciplined - academics, biblical studies, and piano lessons. And it was American - baseball, swimming pools, and <a href="http://www.mottemuseum.com/">classic cars</a>.
</p>

<p>
After high school, I moved to Los Angeles to study International Business at <a href="https://www.pepperdine.edu/">Pepperdine University</a>. I discovered computer programming freshman year, but I stuck with my business degree. I spent nights building websites. After graduation, I merged my two skills and sold websites to businesses.
</p>

<p>
In my 20s, I worked for multiple startups. I did product, engineering, sales, customer support, and even <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/author/scott/">developer evangelism</a>. From this I gained knowledge on how to build a software business.
</p>

<p>
Today, I work in <a href="https://www.alg.com/">corporate fintech</a>. I architect complex financial data processing systems for a team of data scientists and analysts. In my evenings, I am building my own fintech business. 
</p>

<p>
I have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVfou5sA_GxtM68Z9cmtcroN_89hxhXoHIOmbA0/?taken-by=sandeemotte">beautiful wife</a> who has given me two wonderful children.

I create software for my generation 
</p>

<!-- Finance and Investments -->

<!-- 

  I create software for the middle class, so they can attain wealth, so they can become financially independent. 

  give people confidence in their finances


  Who are you? Scott Motte

  What do you do? Create software

  Who do you do it for? Middle class millenials (my generation's middle class) Savers/Investors/Millenials

  What do they want or need? gold, attainable wealth, financial independence, work-life balanace [2]

  How they change as a result? gain financial independence, confidence, pride, reduction of anxiety, focus on building wealth, attainable wealth, maintain their wealth, preserve their wealth, tast of wealth, experience luxury, have real wealth, eternal wealth
    I own gold because it is what rich people do. I own it for its store of value. I own it for its hedge against bad times. I own it for its luxury. I own it because it attracts more wealth. I own it because it changes your thinking on wealth.
    change: my thinking on wealth, my thinking on money.

    i give people lasting wealth
    i give people immutable wealth
    i give people ageless wealth
    i give people everlasting wealth
    i give people timeless wealth
    i give people refined wealth

    different examples: i give kids awesome dreams - write books for children so they can fall asleep at night, so they can have awesome dreams
      help people look and feel their best - i design apparel for men and women who need affordable choices so they can look and feel their best
      help people get great work into the world - i train creative people to take decisive actions so they can get their greatest work into the world

    happier people make it a point to make other people helpful and do things that make them feel well taken care of
