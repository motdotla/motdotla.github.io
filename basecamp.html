  Basecamp,
</p>
<blockquote>
  "Try to do the things that you're incapable of. If you think you're unable to work for the best company in its sphere, make that your aim." - Paul Arden
</blockquote>

<p>
  That quote is from Paul Arden's book "It's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be." And that quote describes both you and me. 
</p>

<p>
  Basecamp is the best company in its sphere. You wrote a web framework that powers probably hundreds of thousands of small and medium business web applications. And you continue to write common sense and forthright business advice that inspires many.
</p>

<p>
  I'm not sure I'm capable of working at Basecamp, but I want to be, and because "it's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be".
</p>

<p>
  That is why I am applying to work with you. I want to become one of the best, by working with the best.

  <strong>A little about me.</strong> I grew up in a small Southern California town called Perris. My family were farmers and then eventually in the real estate business. 
</p>

<p>
  The first programming I ever did was on a TI-83 calculator, but I didn't realize it at the time. It was not until I was in college and given 5mb of free webspace that I started to delve into programming or even technology, for that matter.
</p>

<p>
  You see, I was not from a technical or professional family. I went off to college to study business so I could return back to Perris and help the family small business. 
</p>

<p>
  I was entrepreneurial though. That's why, the last month before the end of my freshman year, when I had discovered I could write HTML and build a webpage, I placed an ad with the newspaper - "$500 Website: I will build, host, and maintain your website".
</p>

<p>
  I was studying abroad the next year and needed travel money. I slaved away on that first site, making the equivalent of only about $2/hr, but I loved all the time I spent on it. It was such a creative process of daily invention and daily discovery. I spent all my spare time as a kid building things with legos. This was legos on a grand scale. Anything was possible.
</p>

<p>
  Over the next few summer months, I did the foot work to secure more clients as well as upgraded my skills to an understanding of Wordpress and Wordpress templates. By the time the new school year started, I had the freedom to work remotely while studying abroad, the clients to keep some cash flow, and an ever growing passion for writing code.
</p>

<p>
  I could go on from here, but suffice it to say that learning to program opened lots of opportunity for me. If my application makes it pass the first round, I would enjoy sharing more with you. I love hearing origin stories of how individuals got into technology. We are the lucky ones.

<p>
  <strong>Some harder facts.</strong> I think it is now time I give you a few harder facts about my experience, so you can decide if you want to take a look at my code and projects.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>About 10 years programming</li>
  <li>About 8 years of Ruby and Ruby on Rails experience on and off depending on my job</li>
  <li>About 20 different applications of significance built on the side over the years [1]</li>
  <li>Almost 200 opens source repos, about 50 of which are reasonably interesting [2]</li>
  <li>Spent 2 years trying out the developer evangelist work life rather than engineering [3]</li>
  <li>Suggested  2 contrarian approaches (with reason) challenging traditional technical approaches. One challenged always reaching for REST and the other challenged username/password authentication. [4][5]</li>
  <li>Founding member of Riverside's first coworking space as a center for tech in the area of Riverside County.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  With the above list, I'm trying to show you that I've written a lot of code, sometimes questioned the status quo by building my own contrarian solutions, and also involved myself in the community. I think these are signals of an independent but empathetic programmer.
</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>
  <strong>Some of my projects.</strong> I've built lots of projects over the years. Like most people, many of these were not completed, but some I saw through to the end.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/digitalocean">Digital Ocean rubygem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>It is an example of employing meta programming where it makes sense.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="https://txtpxl.co/">Pixel Photos</a>
    <ul>
      <li>It is an example of a fully working product complete with illustrations, content, and customer support.</li>
      <li>It demonstrates my abilities as a generalist and as a person who can see things to completion. </li>
      <li>It is a Ruby on Rails application.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/motdotla?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=signature&type=&language=">Signature.io</a>
    <ul>
      <li>I built Signature.io a few years back.</li>
      <li>It demonstrates my ability to create an ecosystem of libraries and tools around a product.</li>
      <li>I shut down Signature.io as a product and open sourced it. It was a pretty cool document signing API while live.</li>
      <li>The Signature Mark piece is particularly interesting for some of it's math to create a more pen like stroke. <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/signature-mark">https://github.com/motdotla/signature-mark</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  I think that is all I can tell you for now without boring you. Hopefully I haven't already. :) You can see more of my work on my website at <a href="http://mot.la">http://mot.la</a>.

<p>
  Thank you for taking the time to read through my application. I hope something caught your eye or at the very least was not boring.</p>
  
<p>
  <strong>I am entering my next 10 years of programming, and I think it will be a promising 10 years.</strong> I would love to spend much of those years at Basecamp learning, struggling, and striving with the best.
