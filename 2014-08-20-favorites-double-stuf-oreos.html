<h2>Favorites: Double Stuf Oreos</h2>

<img src="images/favorites-double-stuf-oreos.jpg"/>

<p>Nick Quinlan has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talk</a> entitled "Favorites". It describes the benefits of not only having favorites but voicing those.</p>

<p>One of my favorites is Double Stuf Oreos with a glass of milk. If I've had a rough day, I like to come home and have a few Double Stuff Oreos. If I've had a good day, I like to. When I run out of oreos I purchase more.</p> 

</p>I dip the oreos in milk for 2-5 seconds and then eat them. Sometimes, I twist an oreo to reveal the stuf. Then I lick the cream, put the remaining cookies back together, dip that in the milk, and then eat that.</p>
