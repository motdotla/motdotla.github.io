  I was terrible at flossing. My dentist consistently scolded me. In response, I built <a href="http://haveyouflossedtoday.com">Flossed Today</a>. It sent you a text message each day, reminding you to floss. You could also track your progress by responding 'yes' or 'no' to each reminder.
  Thanks to the website I actually started flossing and so did others!
</p>

<p>The website employed a combination of technologies such as:</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li>Merb</li>
  <li>Sending of SMS messages through GMail</li>
  <li>Receiving/Parsing of SMS messages with mms2r</li>
  <li>Google Charts API</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://haveyouflossedtoday.com">Flossed Today</a> launched March 2009. <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">Thoughtbot</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/thoughtbot/status/1323447161">tweeted</a> about it.</p>

<p>On February 4th, 2012 I <a href="http://haveyouflossedtoday.com">shut down</a> the website.</p>
