<p>I built <a href="http://github.com/motdotla/dotenv">dotenv</a> one afternoon 
for my own use. I was building lots of NodeJS projects at the time and found
nconf bulky and unweildy for my taste. Dotenv loads configuration via a simple
.env file.</p>

<p>I continue to maintain the library. Additionally, I opted to bring in other
contributors and give them full admin access. That has gone a long way to 
keeping things maintained and taught me some things about shared ownership.</p>

<p>Dotenv has since grown into a very popular library with hundreds of thousands
of downloads a month.</p>

<p>Technologies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Node.js</li>
</ul>
