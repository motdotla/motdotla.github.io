## Startup Shirts

I collect many startup shirts by the nature of my awesome job at [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com). I can't wear them all so I've started giving them away.

Claim yours. I'll mail it to you at no cost!

### Instructions for claiming

1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/scottmotte/scottmotte.github.com/fork)
2. Replace the 'Claim this' text/link on [startup-shirts.html](https://github.com/scottmotte/scottmotte.github.com/blob/master/startup-shirts.html) with your name/link to your website, twitter profile, or other url
3. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/scottmotte/scottmotte.github.com/pulls)  
4. I'll merge your pull rquest and contact you privately for your mailing address
5. You get the shirt! 

Please, only submit one request per month.
