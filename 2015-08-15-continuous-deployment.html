<h2>A Beginners Guide to Continuous Deployment on Amazon EC2</h2>

<p>In this article, I show you how to setup Continuous Deployment to 
Amazon EC2 using <a href="http://codeship.com">Codeship</a> and 
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk.</a></p>

<h3>Setup Codeship Integration</h3>

<p>Begin by <a href="https://codeship.com/pricing">creating a free account on 
Codeship</a>. Then click 'Create New Project'. On the next screen, connect
your source code manager. I chose GitHub.</p>

</a>

<p>Choose your repository. I chose 
<a href="https://github.com/motdotla/ec2-on-node">ec2-on-node</a>.</p>

<a href="images/continuous-deployment/1.png" target="_blank">

</a>

<p>Select `node.js` on the Configure Project page. Then click the `Save and
Go to Dashboard` button.</p>

</a>

<h3>Test Codeship Integration</h3>

<p>Nice, now you are set to test the setup. Create an empty commit on your
project.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Codeship"
git push origin master
</pre></blockquote>

<p>You will see the build change to a `Running` status. You can click on the
build to view more granular data.</p>

</a>

<p>Great! You have continuous integration running with tests. Now you can setup
the continuous deployment to EC2 using Elastic Beanstalk.</p>

<h3>Setup Codeship Deployment</h3>

<p>Click `Project Settings` > `Deployment`.</p>

</a>

<p>On the next screen set the branch to `master` and click `Save pipeline 
settings`.</p>

</a>

<p>Choose `Amazon Elastic Beanstalk` and configure its settings.</p>

</a>

<p>This is where things go a little beyond beginner level. Just take your time. 
It's not too bad.</p>

<h5>A. Setup Elastic Beanstalk</h5>

<p>First, you need an application already setup on Amazon EC2 
and Elastic Beanstalk. Follow the instructions 
<a href="/2015-08-13-ec2-on-node.html">here</a> on how to 
<a href="/2015-08-13-ec2-on-node.html">setup an application on Amazon Elastic 
Beanstalk.</a></p>

<h5>B. Create Deploy User</h5>

<p>Second, create a new user on your Amazon account
named `Codeship` and setup that user's IAM policy. Instructions are 
<a href="https://codeship.com/documentation/continuous-deployment/deployment-to-elastic-beanstalk/">here</a>.</p>

<h5>C. Create Deploy S3 Bucket</h5>

<p>Third and last, create a new S3 bucket 
<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#">here</a> name `codeship-yourname`.</p>

<h5>D. Enter Settings</h4>

<p>When you are all set enter the settings, and click `Create`. 
Here is what mine looks like when completed.</p>

<h3>Test Codeship Deployment</h3>

<p>Lastly, trigger the build one more time. It will deploy after tests pass.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Deployment to Amazon EC2"
git push origin master
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Congratulations! You just setup a really baller continous deployment strategy.</p>
