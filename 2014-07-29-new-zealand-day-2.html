<h2>You Should See the Stars - New Zealand Day 2</h2>

<p>The tip of my finger is burnt. It was from the match I lit. I was trying to light the burner. I succeeded, but it took me 5 matches and a burnt finger.</p>

<p>Adventure! Only a few hours ago I was in Auckland at a shopping mall. Only 2 days ago I was in Sydney at the Hilton. Only 2 weeks ago I was in Los Angeles sleeping in my queen bed.</p>

<p>Now I’m parked up river from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqDdqZ4lWoU">waterfall</a>. I cooked my own dinner - chili beans and toast. Now I’m lying in the bed of my <a href="http://www.spaceshipsrentals.co.nz/">campervan</a> writing this. There’s a large moon roof I’m looking through as I lay. You should see the stars.</p>
