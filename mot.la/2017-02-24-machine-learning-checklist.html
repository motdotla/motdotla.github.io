<h2>Machine Learning Checklist</h2>

<p>This post is a work in progress.</p>

<p>
  I am taking <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Stanford Univerisity's Machine Learning course with Andrew Ng's on Coursera</a>, and beginning to learn about the various formulas available to a Machine Learning Engineer. This post will serve as my attempt to more quickly determine which formula might be a good fit.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Is it supervised learning?
    <ul>
      <li>Can linear regression be applied?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is it unsupervised learning?</li>
<ul>

<h5>Other Notes</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    If alpha (learning rate) is very small then gradient descent can be slow.
    If alpha is very large then gradient descent will be less accurate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gradient descent can still converge to a local minimum, even with alpha (learning rate) fixed.
    This is because the derivative (the slope of the tangential line) is smaller each time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gradient descent will scale better than the Normal Equations Method to solve for the global minimum of the cost function.
  </li>
  <li>
    A vector is a matrix that has only one column.
  </li>
  <li>
    Scalar multiplication is the act of multiplying a matrix by a number.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can only add 2 matrices of the same dimension.
  </li>
  <li>
    Matrix multiplication is used to apply your various hypothesis (get the prediction values) which can then be put into the cost function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Matrices that don't have an inverse are called 'singular' or 'degenerate'.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plot values first. Use a graph if just 2D or 3D (1 or 2 parameters).
  <li>
  <li>
    
  </li>
</ul>
