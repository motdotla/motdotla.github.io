<h2>Gmail Plugins</h2>

<img src="images/gmail.jpg" />

<p>I use Gmail, and like you, my inbox makes me anxious. I receive way too much email. Additionally, I'm of the opinion that in most cases productive work is done outside of email - writing code, negotiating a deal, or getting to know someone.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, email is a great tool of communication to help setup the productive work. It's a necessary evil so to speak. As a result, I try to minimize my time in it as much as possible. Here are the tools I use to help me with that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/">Boomerang</a> - for scheduling emails and following up with emails at a later time</li>
  <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimalist-for-everything/bmihblnpomgpjkfddepdpdafhhepdbek?hl=en-US">Minimalist</a> - for giving Gmail a more minimalist look.</li>
  <li><a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?hl=en">Keyboard shortcuts</a> - for navigating Gmail more quickly. This works well in tanget with Minimalist above because it forces you to use shortcut keys.</li>
  <li><a href="https://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a> - for interacting with people I don't know. I often have to do this, and it gives me very helpful information on who the person might be.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/">Mailbox</a> - not actually a Gmail plugin, but for on the go checking of my email. It lets me move emails to follow up with later - like Boomerang does but on mobile.</li>
</ul>
