<h2>Beginners guide to Mutations with React Native and Relay</h2>

<img src="images/beginners-guide-to-mutations-with-react-native-and-relay.png"/>

<p>
  In this article, I show you how to add mutations (updates) to your React Native Relay application. If you have not already, <a href="/2016-05-08-getting-started-with-react-native-and-relay.html">follow the tutorial on getting started with React Native and Relay</a> so that you already have a foundation.
</p>

<h3>Add the mutation to GraphQL</h3>

<p>
  Open up <code>app/models/schema.rb</code> in your Rails application. [1]
</p>

<p>
  Begin by updating your <code>Schema</code> class to:
</p>

<p>
<code><pre>
Schema = GraphQL::Schema.new(
  query: QueryRoot,
  mutation: MutationRoot
)
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
  Next at the top off that same <code>app/models/schema.rb</code> file, add the
  following:
</p>

<p>
<code><pre>
CreateUserMutation = GraphQL::Relay::Mutation.define do
  name 'CreateUser'

  input_field :email, !types.String

  return_field :user, UserType

  resolve -> (inputs, ctx) {
    user = User.create(email: inputs[:email])
    { user: user }
  }
end

MutationRoot = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
  name 'Mutation'
  description 'Mutations of our application'

  field :createUser, field: CreateUserMutation.field
end
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
  Great work! You just added your first GraphQL mutation.
</p>

<p>
  Start that server up.
</p>

<p>
<code><pre>
bin/rails s -b 127.0.0.1 -p 3000
</pre></code>
</p>

<h3>Add the mutation to React Native Relay</h3>

<p>
  Now that GraphQL is serving up the mutation <code>createUser</code>, we can
  make use of it in our React Native Relay application. [2]
</p>

<p>
  In <code>index.ios.js.</code>, add the following code inside <code>class RelayApp</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code><pre>
class RelayApp extends Component {
  componentWillMount () {
    const mutation = new CreateUserMutation()
    Relay.Store.commitUpdate(mutation)
  }
  ...
}
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
  Next we need to build the actual mutation. Place the following code right above
  the <code>class RelayApp</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code><pre>
class CreateUserMutation extends Relay.Mutation {
  getMutation () {
    return Relay.QL`mutation{ createUser }`
  }

  getVariables () {
    return {
      email: 'hardcoded@RelayApp.com'
    }
  }

  getFatQuery () {
    return Relay.QL`
      fragment on User {
        id,
        email
      }
    `
  }

  getConfigs () {
    return [{
      type: 'FIELDS_CHANGE',
      fieldIDs: {}
    }]
  }
}
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
  That's it. You just created your first mutation in Relay.
</p>

<p>
  <small>
    You might be saying to yourself, "what does all this do" and "sure
    does seem like a lot of ceremony for just a little update", and I would 
    agree with you. But I'm not going to go into all the details in this post.
    For now, I will say that mutations are a weak point of Relay at this time. 
    The API is verbose, but the Relay team is working on simplifying the API.
  </small>
</p>

<p>
  Boot up your React Native RelayApp to see it in action.
</p>

<p>
<code><pre>
react-native run-ios
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
  That's it! As soon as the component mounts it will have created a new User.
</p>

<p>
  <small>
  You'll want to move the <code>createUser</code> mutation to a better location. 
  For example, you probably want it to be called at the moment a user clicks a
  Signup button. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader or as a later post.
