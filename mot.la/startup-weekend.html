  I was a part of the team that took first place at <a href="http://ucirvine.startupweekend.org/2013/02/07/sw-uci-wrap-up-thanks/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend UC Irvine</a>. In one weekend, we built an app called <a href="http://aca.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">A Call to Action</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  It allows advocacy organizations to send a scripted SMS message to its list of supporters on a 5 minute interval. This SMS message prompts the supporter to call their congressperson about a specific bill. As a result, the congressperson receives a real person's phone call every five minutes - overwhelming his or her office.
</p>

<p>
  I created the idea, pitched it at the beginning of Startup Weekend, attracted the team, and led development. Meanwhile, others on our team fleshed out the business plan, created designs, built a mobile app, and prepared a presentation. In the end, we worked together well - taking first prize.
</p>

<p>Technologies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sinatra</li>
  <li>Heroku</li>
  <li>Postgres</li>
  <li>SMS Messages using the Twilio API</li>
</ul>
