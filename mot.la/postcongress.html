  <a href="http://postcongress.io">Postcongress</a> lets you send a real postcard to your senator from the convenience of your computer. It identifies your representatives by your zip code, fills in their mailing address, and lets you craft the perfect message. Upon completion, it programmatically prints and mails the real postcard.
</p>

<p>
  I built <a href="http://postcongress.io">Postcongress</a> after suggestions and encouragement from the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> community - specifically in response to my creation of <a href="fjunkmail.html">F Junk Mail</a>. I used the F Junk Mail code as a platform for building Postcongress. I made adjustments where necessary, created a partiotic design, and added some smart code for determing your representative by zip code. I launched the following weekend. The response was <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4432851">great</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Since then, it has been a powerful tool for both individuals and advocacy groups to get their message out to Federal Representatives.
