  <a href="http://donately.com">Donately</a> is a software platform for accepting donations. It is owned and operated by <a href="http://fiftyandfifty.org">Fifty &amp; Fifty</a>.
<p>

<p>
  I was brought on to evaluate <a href="http://donately.com">Donately</a> and determine what direction it should take next. With my feedback, we decided to build out an API. Once completed we would design a new interface to consume that API.
</p>

<p>
  We did just that. I directed and did the majority of the programming, plus added additional features, and maintained the old site for current clients.
</p>

<p>Technologies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>RESTful API</li>
  <li>Angular.js</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Authorize.net</li>
  <li>Stripe</li>
  <li>PayPal</li>
  <li>Heroku</li>
</ul>
