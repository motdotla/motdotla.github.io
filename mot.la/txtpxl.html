  <a href="https://txtpxl.co">Pixel</a> is a chat-based application for printing photos directly from your phone.
<p>

<p>
  I invented Pixel because my wife and I were finding it time consuming to get real photos printed. Pixel is unique in that you just text your photo to Pixel, and a couple days later it arrives at your doorstep. It is great because it takes less than 5 minutes of your time!
