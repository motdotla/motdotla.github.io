  <a href="http://dntly.com/api#form-js">Donately Form.js</a> lets you put a secure donation form on any webpage. It can be embedded with only a single line of code and uses a secure connection.
<p>

<code>
  &lt;script src='https://www.dntly.com/assets/js/v1/form.js' data-donately-id='11'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>

<p>
  (You can see a live example of this Form.js code embedded at the bottom of this page.)
</p>

<p>
  I proposed the idea of Donately Form.js, the Donately team and I worked out the merits and details of creating such a tool, and we got to work creating it. I handled all the programming - solving multiple challenges in building such a tool and working closely with a UI designer that directed the design and styling.
</p>

<p>
  It is proving a powerful tool - especially for 501(3)(c) organizations that want to accept donations from their main website, but don't have the development team to implement a custom donation form. Additionally, by using Donately Form.js those organizations glean a great deal of metadata about their donors provided by <a href="http://donately.com">Donately</a>.
</p>

<p>Technologies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Heavy use of JavaScript</li>
  <li>Custom iFrame</li>
  <li>SSL</li>
  <li>HTML5 postMessage</li>
  <li>Authorize.net</li>
  <li>Stripe</li>
  <li>PayPal</li>
  <li>Heroku</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Below is the embedded Form.js. You can try it out, but use a fake credit card number - unless you really want to send me a payment.</p>
