<h2>Favorites: G-Eazy</h2>

<p>Last time I wrote a bit about one of my favorites - <a href="http://www.mot.la/2014-08-20-favorites-double-stuf-oreos.html">Double Stuf Oreos</a>. Another of my favorite things is <a href="http://www.g-eazy.com/">G-Eazy</a>.</p>

<p>I like his music. I like the way his rap has elements of 50s and 60s sounds. He even does a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-dxZ3_3oBs">remake of Runaround Sue</a>. I grew up listening to oldies in the backseat of my Father's hotrod. It was the first music I loved. It undoubtably shaped my emotions and thinking. It was a simpler time. G-Eazy's music evokes those 'simpler time' emotions into my life, and I like that.</p>

<p>I like his style. I like the way he wears mostly black. He does it because it's practical - always on the road. But he also does it as a nod to Johnny Cash. Johnny Cash is one of my more favorite historical men. Additionally, I like G-Eazy's clean cut look. It's a style that suits me well and that I use as a model.</p>
