  <a href="http://leaderboardaapp.com">Leaderboard</a> is a mobile website for creating your own professional-like leaderboard at large charity 100 person golf tournaments. Each golfer is able to update his score, and scores are updated live to the leaderboard page. Golfers stay up to date on who is winning the tournament as they play.
</p>

<p>
  I built Leaderboard for a client. The client was a golfer and so was I.
</p>

<p>
  I started by architecting a json API. I then built the front-end interface using backbone.js. The front-end interface interacts with the API to update scores and display new scores live.
</p>

<p>Technologies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Backbone.js</li>
  <li>Padrino</li>
  <li>Mongo</li>
</ul>
