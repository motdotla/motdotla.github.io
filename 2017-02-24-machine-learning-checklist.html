<h2>Machine Learning Checklist</h2>

<p>This post is a work in progress.</p>

<p>
  I am taking <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Stanford Univerisity's Machine Learning course with Andrew Ng's on Coursera</a>, and beginning to learn about the various formulas available to a Machine Learning Engineer. This post will serve as my attempt to more quickly determine which formula might be a good fit.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Is it supervised learning?
    <ul>
      <li>Can linear regression be applied?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is it unsupervised learning?</li>
<ul>
